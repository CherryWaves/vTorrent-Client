Development process
===================

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed
to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new
stable release versions of vTorrent.

The master branch is likely to be unstable or contain work-in-progress
as new features are built and readied for the next release.

vTorrent aims for a regular release cycle of features following a bi-weekly
pace, although the timeframe may vary depending on the complexity of
the backlog.  vTorrent is building a large array of wallet features and 
network/daemon infrastructure to support a large and dynamic ecosystem.

From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and
the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will
be used to issue a warning of closure. The pull will be closed 15 days
after the warning if action is not taken by the author. Pull requests closed
in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.

Issues with no commits will be given a similar warning, and closed after
15 days from their last activity. Issues closed in this manner will be 
labeled 'stale'.
